## Implementation
Classes 
- __CreateCustomFormatter.java__ for the logger
- __Vertex.java__ defined the properties of the nodes in the game tree (value, cost, name, ID, ...) 
- __Graph.java__ defined the methods of the game tree. Contains the __main__ method to start the simulation. 

<br>
<br>

## Full Game Tree 

The full game tree includes 3 sub-trees: 

* WebApp
* DesktopApp
* MobileApp

### Set Parameters
You can set 6 parameters __bevore__ runtime. During runtime params can not be changed. 
Please set the params in the __Graph.java__ class in rows 1134 - 1139 *(Ctr + f and look for "SETUP PARAMETERS")*

- **DEFAULT_PROTECTION_LEVEL**: A integer in {1, 2, 3}. Is translated to either L1, L2 & L3, representing the protection level *(see seminar paper page 4 Def. 2)* 
- **DEFAULT_DEFENDER_VALUE**: Initial value of the defenders value function
- **DEFAULT_ATTACKER_VALUE**: Initial value of the attackers value function
- **nodesToProtect**: Integer between 0 and 30 that describes how many nodes can be protected by the defender in each round 
- **smartProtect**: true/false *(see seminar paper page 5 Def. 3)*
- **conditionalNode**: true/false  *(see seminar paper page 4 chapter 5.1.2)* 

<br>

The higher the amount of protected nodes the higher the chances for the defender to protect the application successfully. The following
plot shows that from a total of 30 protectable nodes the likelihod to protectful successful first increases above 20% if the defender
decides to protect more than 15 nodes (meaning more than half of the nodes):

### Starting the Simulation
Run the main method in __Graph.java__. 

The first param is used to choose the exploration algorithm (__ForwardPropagate__ oder __RandomChoice__).

## Simulation Analysis

The results of each simulation round are logged in __logs.txt__. You can read more about the structure of the
logfile in my seminar paper (page 4, chapter 5.2)

The best strategy for the defender can be derived using the MiniMax algorithm (more details in the seminar paper):
